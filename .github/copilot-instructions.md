## Project Overview
This is a React-TypeScript application built with Vite for collecting student career preferences. The application includes:

1. A student information form (name, gender, school selection)
2. A drag-and-drop interface for sorting job preferences
3. Multiple job sets (3 sets with 12 jobs each)
4. Data storage functionality

## Key Technologies
- React with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop functionality
- Modern CSS for styling

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type definitions
- Follow React functional component patterns with hooks
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Implement proper error handling
- Keep components modular and reusable
